Welcome to DAOrecords

We are building Web3 tools on the NEAR Protocol for artists and labels to publish and manage their catalogs using our FonoRoot NFT minting contract.

Additionally, we are developing a unique dashboard that will incorporate elements of a DAO for users to manage their collaborators and payouts.

If you have any questions you can contact us at hitme@daorecords.org
