Welcome to DAOrecords

Since 2020 we have been actively engaged in experimenting and innovating with Blockchain technology in order to find new ways for musicians to benefit from the tools being created. In the process we have gained valuable experience that we are now putting into practice as we begin development on our project.

DAOrecords is building Web3 tools on the NEAR Protocol for artists and labels to publish and manage their catalogs using our FonoRoot NFT minting contract.

Additionally, we are developing a unique dashboard that will incorporate elements of a DAO for users to manage their collaborators and payouts that connects directly to FonoRoot.
